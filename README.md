# Jon-Mark Hampson

I'm a junior AI engineer with a background in audio technology and embedded systems. Currently studying AI Software Engineering at Masterschool, focusing on Python, audio DSP, and LLM integration.

## Background

Before moving into software, I spent over a decade working with medical and audio technologies - everything from live surgical guidance systems to designing my own line of DSP-powered Eurorack modules under [Apollo View](https://apolloviewmodular.com). That work gave me solid experience with real-world systems, hardware/software integration, and solving complex technical problems.

## Current Focus

Right now I'm building AI-powered tools for creative applications, particularly around audio and synthesis. I'm working with:

- Audio plugin development (C++/JUCE)
- Machine learning for audio processing
- Backend systems with LLMs
- DSP and embedded systems

I'm especially interested in projects where AI meets creative technology - tools that are functional, accessible, and built to last.
